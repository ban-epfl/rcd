This folder contains the implementation of the Recursive Structure Learning algorithm for both diamond-free graphs (RSL-D) and graphs with a bounded clique number (RSL-W). The implementation is based on the paper titled "Learning Bayesian Networks in the Presence of Structural Side Information" by Ehsan Mokhtarian, Sina Akbari, Fateme Jamshidi, Jalal Etesami, and Negar Kiyavash, published in AAAI 2022 (https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/20750/20509).

Details of the approach are given in Section 5.3, and the pseudo-code is given in Section 6.5 of our paper. The RSL-D and RSL-W algorithms are implemented in rsl_d.py, and rsl_w.py, respectively, with the base RSL algorithm implemented in rsl.py. An example of how to use each algorithm is given in rsl_d_demo.py, and rsl_w_demo.py, respectively.
